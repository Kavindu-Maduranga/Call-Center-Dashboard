Call Center Dashboard
![Dash Board](https://github.com/Kavindu-Maduranga/Call-Center-Dashboard/assets/174862031/81ba23fb-1542-48ac-925a-e95727819c4d)
The call center dashboard summarizes call performance for October. It shows the number of calls by channel, call center, sentiment, and response time.  Los Angeles has the most calls (10,639) and Call Center is the most used channel (23,462 calls).  The sentiment with the most calls is very negative (6,026). SLA (Service Level Agreement) is below target at 4,749 calls out of 8,148 calls not meeting SLA.  This could be an area for improvement.
The Data
The data in the image is a spreadsheet that contains information about customer service calls. The spreadsheet includes columns for call sentiment, CSAT score, call timestamp, call day, reason for the call, city, state, channel used for the call, response time, call duration, call center, and SLA (Service Level Agreement) adherence.

Here is a summary of the data:

Calls were made from a variety of locations, including Los Angeles, Baltimore, and Chicago.
The most common reasons for calls were billing questions and service outages.
Calls were handled through a variety of channels, including phone calls, web chats, and emails.
The call center met SLA in a majority of the calls (within SLA).
